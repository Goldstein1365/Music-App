# Music-App

A responsive web-based music player built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Play, pause, skip, and go back between songs
- Volume control with visual feedback
- Playlist sidebar with clickable songs
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- Dynamic song details and cover art

## Project Structure

- `index.html` – Main HTML file for the app UI
- `css/style.css` – Main styles for layout and components
- `css/asset.css` – Responsive and utility styles
- `script/script.js` – All player logic (playlist, controls, audio, etc.)
- `assets/audio/` – MP3 files for each song
- `assets/images/` – Cover images for each song

## How It Works

- The playlist is defined as a JavaScript array of objects in [`script/script.js`](script/script.js).
- Each object contains the song name, audio path, image, and singer.
- The player UI updates dynamically as you interact with controls or select songs from the playlist.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser, or use Live Server in VS Code.
3. Enjoy the music!
